# ml_funnel

The Machine Learning Funnel is a high-level set of tools that allows users to mix and match various preprocessing methods and statistical models. Integrating scikit-learn, category-encoders, imblearn, xgboost, shap, and other modules, users are able to test and implement different "test tubes" in a machine learning funnel and export results for each option selected.

Although scikit-learn has gone a long way toward unifying interfaces with many common machine learning methods, it is still quite clunky and frequent users have become aware of some of its limitations. Present shortcomings include:
1) Often convoluted process for implementing transformers on selected columns.
2) .fit methods doesn't always work with certain forms of encoding (e.g., target encoding in category-encoders).
3) Pipelines and FeatureUnions lack a mix-and-match type grid-search system for preprocessing.
4) Doesn't directly use pandas despite various attempts to bridge the gap (e.g., ml_pandas).
5) Reasonably high learning curve for new programmers or those coming from R, Stata, or other statistical packages.
6) Unintuitive structuring of various preprocessing algorithms to fit with the rigid .fit and .transform methods.
7) Difficulty in implementing different transformers on different groups of data (test, train, full, validation, etc.) within Pipelines

ml_funnel provides a cleaner, universal set of tools to access scikit-learns many useful methods as well as other open-source packages. The goal is to make machine learning more accessible to a wider user base.

To that end, ml_funnel divides the feature engineering and modeling process into ten major method groups:

Scalers: convert numerical features into a common scale (using scikit-learn methods)
Splitters : divides data into train, test, and/or validation sets once or through k-folds cross-validation
Encoders: convert categorical features into numerical ones (using category-encoders methods)
Interactors: convert selected categorical features into new polynomial features (using PolynomialEncoder from category-encoders)
Splicers : create different subgroups of features to allow for easy comparison between them
Samplers : synthetically resample training data for imbalanced data (using imblearn methods) for use with algorithms that struggle with imbalanced data
Selectors : select features recursively or as one-shot based upon user criteria (using sci-kit learn methods)
Models : implement machine learning algorithms (currently includes xgboost and scikit-learn methods)
Grids : test different hyperparameters for the models selected (currently includes RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV - Bayesian methods coming soon)
Plots : produce helpful graphical representations based upon the model selected (includes shap, seaborn, and matplotlib methods)

In addition to the methods included, users can easily add additional methods at any stage using an easy-to-use common parameter format.

Users can easily select different options using a text settings file (ml_settings.ini) or passing appropriate dictionaries to Funnel. This allows the ml_funnel to be used by beginner and advanced python programmers equally.

For example, using the settings file, a user could implement a funnel of different test tubes simply by listing the strings mapped to different methods:

    [funnel]
    scaler = minmax, robust
    splitter = train_test
    splicer = none
    encoder = target, dummy
    interactor = polynomial
    sampler = smote
    selector = none
    algorithm_type = classifier
    algorithms = xgb, random_forest, logit
    search_method = random
    plots = default

ml_funnel also automatically creates the appropriate hyperparameters (and/or hyperparameter searches) based upon user selections:

    [xgb_params]
    booster = gbtree
    objective = binary:logistic
    eval_metric = logloss
    silent = True
    n_estimators = 100, 1000
    max_depth = 5, 30
    learning_rate = 0.001, 1.0
    subsample = 0.4, 0.6
    colsample_bytree = 0.4, 0.6
    colsample_bylevel = 0.4, 0.6
    min_child_weight = 0.5, 1.5
    gamma = 0.0, 0.1
    alpha = 0.5, 1

In the above case, anywhere two values are listed, ml_funnel automatically implements a hyperparameter search between those values. If just one hyperparameter is listed, it stays fixed throughout the tests. The hyperparameters are automatically linked to the 'xgb' model by including that prefix to '_params' in the settings file.

ml_funnel currently supports GPU modeling for xgboost and will implement it for other incorporated models with built-in GPU support.

In addition to the implementation of the ten steps above, summary statistics and results (appropriate to the models) are exported to user-selected formats in either dynamically created or selected paths.
