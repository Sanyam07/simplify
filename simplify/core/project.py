@dataclass
class Project(MutableMapping):
    """Controller class for siMpLify projects.

    Args:
        idea (Union[Idea, str]): an instance of Idea or a string containing the
            file path or file name (in the current working directory) where a
            file of a supported file type with settings for an Idea instance is
            located. Even though a default value is provided (None) to lessen
            subclass MRO problems, 'idea' is required for a Project to work.
        inventory (Optional[Union['Inventory', str]]): an instance of Inventory
            or a string containing the full path of where the root folder should
            be located for file output. A inventory instance contains all file
            path and import/export methods for use throughout the siMpLify
            package. Default is None.
        ingredients (Optional[Union['Ingredients', 'Ingredient', pd.DataFrame,
            np.ndarray, str]]): an instance of Ingredients, an instance of
            Ingredient, a string containing the full file path where a data file
            for a pandas DataFrame is located, a string containing a file name
            in the default data folder (as defined in the shared Inventory
            instance), a full folder path where raw files for data to be
            extracted from, a string containing a folder name which is an
            attribute in the shared Inventory instance, a DataFrame, or numpy
            ndarray. If a DataFrame, Ingredient instance, ndarray, or string is
            passed, the resultant data object is stored in the 'data' attribute
            in a new Ingredients instance as a DataFrame. Default is None.
        workers (Optional[List[str], str]): ordered list of workers to call.
            Each worker should match a key in 'workers'. Defaults to an empty
            list. If no 'workers' are provided, a Project instance attempts to
            find them in 'idea'.
        library (Optional[Dict[str, Union['Worker', 'Book']]]): attribute
            which stores the siMpLify objects which are iterated by Project. If
            not passed or later populated, the internally stored
            'default_workers' is used when 'publish' is called. Defaults to an
            empty dictionary.
        auto_publish (Optional[bool]): whether to call the 'publish' method when
            instanced. Defaults to True.
        auto_apply (Optional[bool]): whether to call the 'apply' method when
            instanced. For auto_apply to have an effect, 'ingredients' must also
            be passed. Defaults to False.
        name (Optional[str]): designates the name of the class used for internal
            referencing throughout siMpLify. If the class needs settings from
            the shared Idea instance, 'name' should match the appropriate
            section name in Idea. When subclassing, it is a good idea to use
            the same 'name' attribute as the base class for effective
            coordination between siMpLify classes. 'name' is used instead of
            __class__.__name__ to make such subclassing easier. Defaults to
            'project'.
