class Cookbook(SimplePackage):

    Args:
        name (str): designates the name of the class which should match the
            section of settings in the Idea instance and other methods
            throughout the siMpLify package. If subclassing siMpLify classes,
            it is often a good idea to maintain to the same 'name' attribute
            as the base class for effective coordination between siMpLify
            classes.
        ingredients (Ingredients, DataFrame, Series, ndarray, or str): an 
            instance of Ingredients, a string containing the full file path of 
            where a data file for a pandas DataFrame or Series is located, a 
            string containing a,file name in the default data folder, as defined 
            in the shared Depot instance, a DataFrame, a Series, or numpy 
            ndarray. If a DataFrame, ndarray, or string is provided, the 
            resultant DataFrame is stored at the 'df' attribute in a new 
            Ingredients instance.
        recipes (Recipe or list(Recipe)): Ordinarily, 'recipes' is not passed
            when Cookbook is instanced, but the argument is included if the
            user wishes to reexamine past recipes or manually create new
            recipes.
        techniques (dict): keys are names of techniques to be applied and 
            values are the siMpLify-compatible python objects applying those 
            techniques.

    Since this class is a subclass to SimplePackage and SimpleClass, 
    documentation for those classes applies as well.
