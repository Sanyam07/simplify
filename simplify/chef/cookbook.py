    """Dynamically creates recipes for staging, machine learning, and data
    analysis using a unified interface and architecture.

    Parameters:
        ingredients: an instance of Ingredients (or a subclass). This argument
            does not need to be passed when the class is instanced. However,
            failing to do so will prevent the use of the Cleave step and the
            _compute_hyperparameters method. 'ingredients' will need to be 
            passed to the 'produce' method if it isn't when the class is
            instanced. Consequently, it is recommended that 'ingredients' be
            passed when the class is instanced.
        steps: a list of string step names to be completed in order. This 
            argument should only be passed if the user wishes to override the 
            steps listed in the Idea settings or if the user is not using the
            Idea class.
        recipes: a list of instances of Recipe which Cookbook creates through
            the 'finalize' method and applies through the 'produce' method.
            Ordinarily, 'recipes' is not passed when Cookbook is instanced, but
            the argument is included if the user wishes to reexamine past
            recipes or manually create new recipes.
        name: a string designating the name of the class which should be
            identical to the section of the Idea section with relevant settings.
        auto_finalize: sets whether to automatically call the 'finalize' method
            when the class is instanced. If you do not plan to make any
            adjustments to the steps, techniques, or algorithms beyond the
            Idea configuration, this option should be set to True. If you plan
            to make such changes, 'finalize' should be called when those changes
            are complete.
        auto_produce: sets whether to automatically call the 'produce' method
            when the class is instanced.
