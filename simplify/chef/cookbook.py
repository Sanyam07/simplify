class Cookbook(SimpleManager):
    """Dynamically creates recipes for staging, machine learning, and data
    analysis using a unified interface and architecture.

    Args:
        ingredients(Ingredients or str): an instance of Ingredients or a string
            with the file path for a pandas DataFrame that will. This argument
            does not need to be passed when the class is instanced. However,
            failing to do so will prevent the use of the Cleave step and the
           '_calculate_hyperparameters' method. 'ingredients' will need to be
            passed to the 'read' method if it isn't when the class is
            instanced. Consequently, it is recommended that 'ingredients' be
            passed when the class is instanced.
        steps(dict(str: SimpleStep)): steps to be completed in order. This
            argument should only be passed if the user wishes to override the
            steps listed in the Idea settings or if the user is not using the
            Idea class.
        recipes(Recipe or list(Recipe)): Ordinarily, 'recipes' is not passed 
            when Cookbook is instanced, but the argument is included if the user
            wishes to reexamine past recipes or manually create new recipes.
        name(str): designates the name of the class which should be identical
            to the section of the idea configuration with relevant settings.
        auto_publish(bool): whether to call the 'publish' method when the
            class is instanced. If you do not plan to make any
            adjustments to the steps, techniques, or algorithms beyond the
            Idea configuration, this option should be set to True. If you plan
            to make such changes, 'publish' should be called when those
            changes are complete.
        auto_read(bool): whether to call the 'read' method when the class
            is instanced.
            
    Since this class is a subclass to SimpleManager and SimpleClass, all
    documentation for those classes applies as well.
