"""DEFAULT_OPTIONS are declared at the top of a module with a SimpleClass
subclass because siMpLify uses a lazy importing system. This locates the
potential module importations in roughly the same place as normal module-level
import commands. A SimpleClass subclass will, by default, add the
DEFAULT_OPTIONS to the subclass as the 'options' attribute. If a user wants
to use another set of 'options' for a subclass, they just need to pass
'options' when the class is instanced.
